# redarch

[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/redarch/)

This is a package to interact with the old reddit archives maintained by the [NCRI](https://networkcontagion.us/reports/). For legal reasons, the author of this software provides only the software, not the data, and doesn't take any responsibility for your use of the reddit data. If you do use the reddit data, you should probably download the data from an approved source, like [pushshift](https://pushshift.io), instead of secondary sources like the-eye.eu or academictorrents.com.
